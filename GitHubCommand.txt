On Windows GIT Bash Ctrl + X would do nothing and found out it works quite like 
vi/vim. Press i to enter inline insert mode. Type the description at the very 
top, press esc to exit insert mode, then type :x! (now the cursor is at the 
bottom) and hit enter to save and exit.

You can save your file and quit using: :wq filename Enter or; :x filename Enter.
